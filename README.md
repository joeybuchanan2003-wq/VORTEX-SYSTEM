VERTEX Player's Handbook
Introduction
Design Philosophy: Skill-Driven, Consequence-Focused. Welcome to VERTEX, a universal roleplaying game system designed for campaigns where character skill, gritty realism, and meaningful choices are paramount. Whether you are exploring forgotten ruins in a fantasy world, navigating the neon-drenched streets of a cyberpunk future, or solving crimes in a noir-inspired past, VERTEX provides a robust and intuitive framework for your stories. The system uses a d100 (percentile) engine to provide a clear and immediate measure of a character's chance of success, ensuring that every roll is tense and every outcome matters.
Part 1: The Core Mechanic
Every action in VERTEX that has a meaningful chance of failure is resolved by rolling percentile dice against a target number. This is known as a Percentile Test.
The Percentile Test
When your character attempts a challenging action, the Game Master (GM) will ask you to make a Percentile Test. The process is simple:
Determine the Skill and Target Number: The GM identifies the governing Skill for the action (e.g., Stealth to sneak, Ranged Combat to shoot). Your rating in that Skill is your base Target Number. Based on the difficulty of the task, the GM may apply a Situational Modifier to create a final Target Number for this specific test (see Part 1A).
Roll the Dice: Roll two ten-sided dice (2d10). Designate one as the "tens" digit and one as the "units" digit to generate a number from 1 to 100. A roll of "00" is treated as 100.
Compare the Result:
If your roll is less than or equal to your Target Number, you succeed.
If your roll is greater than your Target Number, you fail.
Degrees of Success & Failure
The quality of your roll can dramatically alter the outcome.
Critical Success (Roll 01-05): You succeed with an exceptional, often unexpected, positive outcome.
Hard Success (Roll ≤ Half Skill): If your roll is less than or equal to half of your Skill's Target Number (rounded down), your success is notably effective.
Success (Roll ≤ Skill): You achieve your goal as intended.
Critical Failure (Fumble, Roll 96-100): You fail in a disastrous way, and the GM should introduce a new, negative complication.
#### Part 1A: The Art of the Skill Check (GM Guidance) Your role as the Game Master is to be the narrator and referee of the world. A key part of this is deciding when a Percentile Test is needed and how difficult that test should be. A task's difficulty is represented by Situational Modifiers.
##### When to Roll (And When Not To) Before asking for a roll, ask yourself: Is a roll necessary? Could the character reasonably accomplish this without a chance of meaningful failure? A soldier climbing a standard fence doesn't need to roll Athletics; they just do it. This is an Automatic Success. Only call for a roll when there is pressure, a time limit, or a genuine consequence for failure.
##### The Core Tool: Situational Modifiers A Situational Modifier is a bonus (+) or penalty (-) you apply directly to the character's Skill Rating before they roll. This creates a new, temporary Target Number for that specific test.
The Formula: Final Target Number = Skill Rating +/– Modifier
Here is a table of suggested modifiers:

Difficulty
Modifier
Example
Very Easy
+30
Picking a very simple lock with no pressure.
Easy
+10
Jumping over a low sports car to get to cover.
Routine
+0
The default for a standard, challenging task.
Hard
-10
Jumping over a tall SUV to get to cover.
Very Hard
-30
Trying to perform surgery in the back of a moving truck.
Nearly Impossible
-50
Persuading a king to give you his crown.

##### Advanced Tool: Requiring a Hard Success For tasks that require exceptional precision, instead of (or in addition to) applying a penalty, you can declare that a Hard Success is required to achieve the desired outcome. A standard success might result in a partial or less effective result.
Example: Disarming a bomb. A standard Mechanics success might stop the countdown but leave the device unstable. A Hard Success is required to render it completely safe.
Part 2: Character Creation
A character is defined by a set of core Attributes, which form the foundation for their Skills and other capabilities.
Attributes
There are six core Attributes that represent a character's raw potential, typically ranging from 5 (deficient) to 20 (peak human potential).
Strength (STR): Physical power, muscle, and brute force.
Constitution (CON): Health, stamina, and resilience.
Dexterity (DEX): Agility, speed, reflexes, and coordination.
Intellect (INT): Logic, reasoning, memory, and knowledge.
Willpower (WIL): Mental fortitude, discipline, charisma, and leadership.
Perception (PER): Awareness, senses, and the ability to notice details.
Derived Statistics
Hit Points (HP): Your physical health: CON +5
Resolve Points (RP): Your mental health and composure. This pool is also used to power spells. Formula: Equal to your WIL score.
Luck Points: A resource used to alter fate. Formula: WIL / 5, rounded down.
Character Creation Steps
Follow these steps to create your VERTEX character.
Step 1: Concept First, decide on your character's core concept...
Step 2: Choose a Genre & Race Work with your GM to determine the campaign's genre...
Step 3: Generate Attributes All six of your Attributes start with a base of 5. You have 45 points to distribute among them...
Step 4: Calculate Derived Stats Use your final Attribute scores to calculate your starting HP, RP, and Luck Points.
Step 5: Choose a Profession Select a Profession from the list appropriate to your genre...
Step 6: Allocate Skill Points
Your starting pool of Skill Points is equal to: 150
Your race may grant you additional bonus Skill Points.
For any skill, its Base Rating is equal to its governing Attribute's score.
It costs 1 Skill Point to increase a skill's rating by 1.
You receive a free +10 bonus to each of your Professional Skills. This does not cost any skill points.
No skill can be raised above a total of 75 during character creation.
Part 3: Skills & Advancement
The Channeling Skill
Channeling (WIL): This new skill governs a character's ability to safely control and manifest supernatural power. Its governing attribute is Willpower, representing the discipline and mental force required to shape reality.
Advancement Characters improve their skills through successful use and practice.
Check a Skill: When you succeed at a Skill Test, place a checkmark next to that skill on your character sheet. You can only have one checkmark per skill at a time.
Attempt Improvement: At the end of a game session, you can attempt to improve any skill with a checkmark. For each checked skill, roll d100.
Roll for Increase: If you roll higher than your current Skill Rating, it increases by 1d4 points. If you roll lower than or equal to your current rating, you've learned all you can from that experience for now. Erase the checkmark and wait for the next success.
Part 4: Combat
Combat in VERTEX is resolved in tense, turn-based rounds.
Initiative At the start of a combat, every participant rolls 1d10 + their DEX score. The highest total goes first, with turns proceeding in descending order. Ties are broken by the higher DEX score.
The Action Economy On your turn, your character is a capable combatant who can perform multiple actions. You have:
One Major Actions
One Minor Actions 
Move = Move up to your DEX score in meters
Major Actions
Attack: Make a melee or ranged attack against an opponent.
Use a Complex Skill: Perform a skill under pressure (e.g., Medicine to stabilize a dying friend, Mechanics to hotwire a car during a chase, Persuasion to de-escalate a conflict).
Defend: You focus on survival. You gain a +10 bonus to all defensive tests (like Dodge and Parry) until the start of your next turn.
Aim: You spend significant time lining up a shot. You gain a +20 bonus to your next Ranged Combat test this turn.
Go Prone / Take Cover: Dive behind a barricade or onto the ground, making you harder to hit.
Sprint: Move up to double your normal movement distance.
Activate a Power or Complex Device: Cast a spell, use a psionic ability, or operate complex machinery.
Minor Actions
Draw/Stow a Weapon: Unholster a pistol, draw a sword, or put one away.
Interact with an Object: Open a door, kick over a table, pick up an item.
Speak: Shout a short phrase or warning.
Change Stance: Drop to one knee.
Making an Attack Attacking is an Opposed Test between the attacker's combat skill and the target's defense.
The attacker makes their Melee Combat or Ranged Combat test.
The defender chooses how to react and makes a corresponding test:
Dodge (Athletics Skill): Attempt to dive out of the way of any attack.
Parry (Melee Combat Skill): Attempt to block an incoming melee attack. A character must have a melee weapon or shield to Parry.
The outcome is determined by comparing the results:
Attacker Succeeds, Defender Fails: The attack hits. Roll for damage.
Attacker Fails, Defender Succeeds/Fails: The attack misses.
Both Succeed: The one with the higher Degree of Success wins (Critical > Hard > Success). If the degrees are tied, the attack is a glancing blow that deals only half damage.
Damage, Armor & Injury
Rolling Damage: If an attack hits, roll damage based on the weapon. Add any relevant bonuses (e.g., half of your STR score, rounded up, for melee attacks).
A Hard Success on the attack roll adds half the weapon's base die as extra damage (e.g., +4 for a 1d8 weapon).
A Critical Success on the attack roll adds the maximum possible damage from the weapon's dice (e.g., +8 for a 1d8 weapon).
Armor: Subtract the target's Armor Value (AV) from the total damage. The remaining damage is dealt to the target's HP.
Dropping to 0 HP: When a character's HP drops to 0, they fall unconscious and are Dying. They will die in a number of rounds equal to their CON score unless they receive successful first aid from a Medicine test.
Major Wounds: If a character takes more than half their maximum HP from a single attack, they must immediately make a Hard (half) CON test. On a failure, they suffer a Major Wound. The GM determines the specifics, but this could be a broken limb (-20 to all DEX-based tests), internal bleeding (lose 1 HP per round), or being stunned for a round.
Part 5: Magic and Spellcasting
Magic, psionics, and other supernatural abilities are powerful but taxing forces, channeled through a character's mental fortitude.
Casting Spells
Action: Casting a spell is a Major Action.
Spell Point (SP) Cost: Every spell has a Spell Point (SP) cost. This cost is deducted from the caster's Resolve Points (RP) pool. If a caster does not have enough RP to pay the spell's cost, they cannot cast it.
Casting Test: To cast a spell, the character must make a Channeling Percentile Test.
Success: The spell takes effect as described.
Failure: The spell fails to manifest. The SP cost is still paid.
Critical Failure (Fumble): On a roll of 96-100, the Channeling goes horribly wrong. 
Characters with a Channeling skill above 50 begins play knowing a number of spells equal to their INT score. They may learn more during play at the GM's discretion.
